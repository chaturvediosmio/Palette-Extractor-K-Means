# Palette-Extractor-K-Means
Unsupervised Learning mini-project.

Using K-Means Clustering, extract the palette of an image.

A total of k colors act as centroids, those k colors are said to be te palette of the image.
This program can be used as a color picker as it outputs the most predominant colors in hex format.(especially useful for webpage designing)

We can also change the color of every pixel to be the color closest to a centroid, essentially reducing the image to consist of at most k colors.
