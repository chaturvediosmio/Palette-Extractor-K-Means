# Palette-Extractor-K-Means
Unsupervised Learning mini-project.
Using K-Means Clustering, extract the palette of an image
A total of k colors act as centroids, those k colors are said to be te palette of the image.
We can change the color of every pixel to be the color closest to a centroid, essentially reducing the image to consist of at most k colors.
